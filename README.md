A quickly hacked-together solution with Express JS serving a static HTML with autoComplete.js and a REST endpoint to serve with data.

`npm run build` to trigger a webpack build - all assets land under dist.
`npm run watch` to continuously build and catch all changes during development and re-create dist contents.
`npm start` to start the Express JS server.

The idea is to re-use the code from this repo in other projects.
